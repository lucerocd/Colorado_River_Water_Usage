Corado River Water Usage by State

The purpose of this application is to display the amount of water from the Colorado River used by each state on a per capita basis and compare this to the number of dams on the Colorado River in that state.

The point data for this application came from the Wikipedia's "List of dams in the Colorado River system" page and it is available at the link provided in the map. The raw polygon data for this map comes from a USAToday article titled "Mapping Colorado River water: How California, Arizona and Nevada plan to use less". This data provided the amount of water in million acre-feet which the map maker then converted into gallons and divided by the population to get a yearly per capita use. Population data was provided by the US Census Bureau. 

The symbolization of this application starts with a choropleth map starting from light colors to indicate less per capita water use and gets progressively darker with an increase in per capita water use. On top of the chloropleth map, I overlaid point symbols representing dams along the Colorado River system and their primary purpose.

The design of this application is based off principles learned from lecture 11 of Web Mapping into the construction and styling of interactive bivariate maps.
